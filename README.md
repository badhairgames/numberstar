## How to play
Pick from one of the three available game modes: Standard, Timed and Practice.

Each mode presents a series of random questions and four possible answers. Select the correct answer before the time
runs out!

Both Standard and Timed allow you to select a difficulty level. Practice mode lets you choose the numbers and
operators you want to revise. This lets you practice your 7 times tables, for example.

Standard mode keeps going until you run out of lives. In timed and practice mode, answer as many questions as you
can within a minute.
